🌎 I'm based in the United Kingdom and am currently a bootcamper at the School Of Code. Here I have been diving into the world of tech and have been loving it.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning react and next.js. I have been dabbling in these and have found that they both offer a range of advantages including: Component-Based Architecture, Virtual DOM, Server-Side Rendering and many more!

- 🤝 I’m looking to improve my skills in CSS. I enjoy UI design and would love to bring my ideas to life more fluidly!

- 🎨I enjoy painting in my free time, cooking, alongside digital designing!!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love animals!!! Especially cats which are my favourite 🐱🐱🐱 (as you may be able to tell from my the gif at the top of my profile). I also enjoy nature and outdoor activities 🍃🌷

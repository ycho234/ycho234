<h3 align="center">🌎 I'm a based in the United Kingdom. I'm currently a bootcamper at the School Of Code and have been diving into the world of tech.</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **react and next.js. I have been dabbling in these and have so far found them to be very useful. I have found that they both offer a range of advantages including: Component-Based Architecture, Virtual DOM, Server-Side Rendering and many more!**

- 🤝 I’m looking to improve **my skills in CSS. I enjoy UI design and would like to bring these ideas to life more fluidly!**

- ⚡ Fun fact: **I love animals!!! Especially cats which are my favourite 🐱🐱🐱 (as you may be able to tell from my profile). I also enjoy nature and outdoor activities 🍃🌷**
